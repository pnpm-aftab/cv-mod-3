CSc 8830: Computer Vision
Module 3 Assignment
Submission in Classroom:
Manage all your code in a github repo for each assignment. Provide a link to the repo in the PDF document. You can choose to program in either C/C++ or Python or MATLAB. Submit the script with clear commenting and ReadMe documentation on top of each script to execute the script.
Create a working demonstration of your application and record a screen-recording or a properly captured footage of the working system.
Upload the PDF document and video in the Google classroom submission. (copying the script in the document is not required; GitHub repo must be accessible)
For parts that require or ask for "solve by hand" or "show by example" methods:
convert your problem solving by hand into a digital format (typed or scanned only. You can use camera scanner apps) and embedded/appended into the final PDF documentation. Camera images of paper worksheets will NOT be accepted



Question
Implement image blurring using a filtering approach. Show that the outcome using spatial filters is the same as using the fourier domain equivalent of the filter. Show that convolution in space is the same as multiplication in frequency (fourier) domain.
